Hey there!

This is just some fun proactice I had attempting to re-create this site: https://www.maloufcompanies.com/.
My goal was to ONLY use HTML and CSS. I haven't gotten to making it mobile friendly just yet.

I had a lot of fun with this project and thought it was a really good test of my skills!
