              Award-winning, cutting-edge, ever-evolving: just a few words that
              describe our approach to business. We start with great people,
              then empower them with the tools to get the job done. We’ve
              strategically hand-selected business acquisitions and licensing
              partners to create a unique portfolio unlike any of our
              competitors.

                        Formalized in 2016 as our charity arm, the Malouf Foundation™ is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to confronting child sexual exploitation, specifically sex trafficking and online abuse. The Foundation fulfills its mission by providing education, promoting healing, and furthering advocacy for survivors. In 2022, the Elizabeth Smart Foundation officially became a part of the Malouf Foundation™ to broaden the impact of both organizations.
